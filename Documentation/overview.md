### Frontend for Teaching (Admin Panel)

#### Functionality:
- Add new triggers and responses.
- Edit existing triggers and responses.
- Delete triggers and responses.
- View a list of all triggers and responses.

#### Technologies:
- HTML/CSS for structure and styling.
- JavaScript for client-side interactions.
- Possibly a frontend framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular for easier state management and interactivity.

#### Components:
- Trigger Input: Text field to input new triggers.
- Response Input: Text field to input corresponding responses.
- Button to Add: Add new triggers and responses to the database.
- List of Triggers and Responses: Display all existing triggers and responses.
- Edit and Delete Buttons: Options to edit or delete existing triggers and responses.

#### Flow:
1. User enters a trigger and its corresponding response.
2. User clicks the "Add" button to save the new trigger-response pair.
3. The frontend sends an API request (POST or PUT) to the backend with the new data.
4. The backend updates the database with the new trigger-response pair.
5. The frontend updates the list of triggers and responses to reflect the changes.

### Frontend for Interacting (Chat Interface)

#### Functionality:
- Enter text to chat with the bot.
- View bot responses.
- Simple, clean design for easy conversation flow.

#### Technologies:
- Same as above: HTML/CSS, JavaScript.
- Frameworks or libraries for real-time chat updates (like Socket.IO).

#### Components:
- Chat Input: Text field for user to enter messages.
- Chat Area: Display area for the conversation history.
- Send Button: Button to send user messages to the bot.
- Real-time Updates: Bot responses appear in real-time as they are received.

#### Flow:
1. User enters a message in the chat input and presses "Send".
2. The frontend sends the message to the backend via an API request (POST).
3. The backend processes the message, retrieves a response from the bot logic, and sends it back.
4. The frontend displays the response in the chat area.
5. This continues in a loop for ongoing conversation.

### Technologies Overview

#### Frontend:
- HTML/CSS: Structure and styling.
- JavaScript: Client-side interactivity.
- React, Vue.js, Angular: Frontend frameworks for enhanced functionality.
- Axios or Fetch API: For making API requests to the backend.

#### Backend:
- Flask or Django: Python web frameworks for the backend server.
- RESTful API: Endpoints to handle CRUD operations for triggers and responses.
- MongoDB: Database to store trigger-response pairs.
- pymongo: Python library for interacting with MongoDB.

### Example Steps:
1. Create a simple HTML/CSS layout for both the Admin Panel and Chat Interface.
2. Use JavaScript to add interactivity to the UI components.
3. Implement API endpoints on the backend to handle CRUD operations for triggers and responses.
4. Connect the frontend components to the backend using Axios or Fetch API.
5. Test the functionality of both front ends: adding new triggers, editing, deleting, and chatting with the bot.
